#1. Overview of the Game
===========================================================================


#2. How to Play
===========================================================================


#3. Scoring
===========================================================================
The following list below is how each value of the dice is worth that number of points: <br/>
1: 1000 points <br/>
2: 200 points <br/>
3: 300 points <br/>
4: 400 points <br/>
5: 500 points <br/>
6: 600 points <br/>

The following list below is how the scoring of the game works: <br/>
1: Each 1's are worth 100 points. <br/>
5: Each 5's are worth 50 points. <br/>
3 of a kind: Score = number of scoring dice * 100 <br/>
4 of a kind: Score = 2 * (3 of a kind score) <br/>
5 of a kind: Score = 3 * (3 of a kind score) <br/>
6 of a kind: Score = 4 * (3 of a kind score) <br/>
(The 6 of a kind rule applies to all matching dice values except 6 1's, which is an instant win.) <br/>

#4. Winning the Game
===========================================================================
There are two ways to win the game of 10000 dice: <br/>
The game continues until a player has reached 10000 as their total score. The first player to do so is the winner. <br/>
If one player managed to roll all 6 1's during their turn, this player wins the game. <br/>
