Declare a new Tkinter variable called root.
Set title to '10,000 Dice', window size to 400x400, and background color to black.
Ensure that the window size stays fixed, so disallow users from resizing the window.
Declare a variable called stringme and set as StringVar().
Declare a Boolean variable called selected and set to false.

def randomGen():
    Declare an empty list called ls.
    Declare a list called dice containing the six unicode names for the die value.
    for i in range(6):
        If one of the dice has been selected for scoring, ignore and continue.
        Randomly pick of the dice from the list and append it into ls.
    Declare a ariable called lis and join ls into it as string.
    Set lis into stringme.
    
def playerTurn():
    #This function applies to both the human and the ai player. The difference is that during the player's turn, the user can make a move via input.
    
def scorePoints():
    #Scoring for the game takes place here, along with special conditions outside of the scoring system.

def whoWon():
    #To check if the player wins, either verify if a player's score is 10000 or the player has rolled all 6 ones during their turn.
    #If any of the two conditions are true, then that player wins the game.
